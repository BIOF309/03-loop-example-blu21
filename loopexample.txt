A for loop can used in a fluorescence assay for example to find the sample with the highest and lowest fluorescence signal. The loop can take in a list of all the fluorescence values and determine the largest and smallest values from the list.

Pseudocode
ListF = [a,b,c, ...] #where a, b, and c are some integers representing fluorescent units.

maxF = 0 #Set maxF as the variable representing the largest fluorescence value
minF = 9999999999 #Set minF as the variable representing the smallest fluorescence value. I made the current value an integer that is higher than any of the integers in the List.

#creating the for loop
for i in ListF:
    if i > maxF
        maxF = i
    if i < minF
        minF = i

print ("The highest fluorence value is " + maxF) #prints out highest value
print ("The lowest fluorescence value is " + minF) #prints out lowest value
